As a guest
In order to update my booking information
I want to be able to send a PUT request with the booking ID and updated details

Acceptance Criteria:
- The endpoint should accept a booking ID as a parameter in the path
- The updated booking details should be provided in the request body in JSON format
- If the update is successful, the server should respond with the updated booking details and a status of "OK" (200)
- If the booking ID is invalid or missing, the server should respond with a "Bad Request" error (400)
- Optionally, a token can be provided in the cookie for authentication
