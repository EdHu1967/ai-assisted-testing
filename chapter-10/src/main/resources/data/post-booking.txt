As a guest
In order to make a new booking
I want to be able to send a POST request with the booking details

Acceptance Criteria:
- The endpoint should accept booking details in the request body in JSON format
- If the booking is successful, the server should respond with the booking details and a status of "OK" (200)
- If the booking request is invalid, the server should respond with a "Bad Request" error (400)
- Optionally, a token can be provided in the cookie for authentication
