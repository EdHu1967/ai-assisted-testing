As a guest
In order to retrieve a summary of bookings for a specific room
I want to be able to send a GET request with the room ID

Acceptance Criteria:
- The endpoint should accept a room ID as a query parameter
- The server should respond with a summary of bookings for the specified room
- If the room ID is missing or invalid, the server should respond with a "Bad Request" error (400)
- Optionally, a token can be provided in the cookie for authentication

HTTP Payload contract
{
  "bookings": [
    {
      "bookingDates": {
        "checkin": "String",
        "checkout": "String"
      }
    }
  ]
}
