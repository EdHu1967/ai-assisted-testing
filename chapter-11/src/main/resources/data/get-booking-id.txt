As a guest
In order to retrieve information about a booking
I want to be able to send a GET request with the booking ID

Acceptance Criteria:
- The endpoint should accept a booking ID as a parameter in the path
- If a valid booking ID is provided, the server should respond with the details of the booking
- If the booking ID is invalid or missing, the server should respond with a "Bad Request" error (400)
- Optionally, a token can be provided in the cookie for authentication

HTTP Payload contract
{
  "bookingid": Integer,
  "roomid": Integer,
  "firstname": "String",
  "lastname": "String",
  "depositpaid": Boolean,
  "bookingdates": {
    "checkin": "String",
    "checkout": "String"
  }
}
