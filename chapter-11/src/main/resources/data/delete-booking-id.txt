As a guest
In order to cancel my booking
I want to be able to send a DELETE request with the booking ID

Acceptance Criteria:
- The endpoint should accept a booking ID as a parameter in the path
- If a valid booking ID is provided, the server should cancel the booking and respond with a status of "OK" (200)
- If the booking ID is invalid or missing, the server should respond with a "Bad Request" error (400)
- Optionally, a token can be provided in the cookie for authentication
